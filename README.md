## Why PreQC Pack?
Traditional solutions require multiple software combinations to calculate indicators for quality pre-evaluation, which is costly and time-consuming. Whether it is possible to develop a low-cost and low-resource-consumption software to generate the required pre-evaluation indicators at one time? So we develop the preqc-pack.
